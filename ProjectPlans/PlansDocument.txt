Title: Cataffliction (TBD if that is the hardset name)
Genre: Top Down Horror Shooter

Story Concept: You, the player, are a robot that has awoken in an abandoned factor. A distress signal awoke you
	       from stasis, and you must descend the factories floors in order to find it. There are terrible
	       creatures in the factory that will attempt to stop you as you continue. Whatever you do, do not 
	       lose yourself to their hivemind. (Rewrite this later properly together)

---------
